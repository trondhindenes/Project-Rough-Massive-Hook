# Rough-Massive-Hook
Proof of concept for n-tier app using modern tooling

### That name tho??
Found in in some project name generator. Thought it sounded kool.

### The why
Lots of orgs have huge codebases built around .Net "classic" and don't have an easy migration path to Containers. This project attempts to prove that it's possible to build a modern "microservice-like" application stack using modern tooling for service discovery, traffic routing and config/deploy.
